# decoding

< Hi guys >
 
I brought you an interesting and fun game called decoding.
In this game, you must be able to guess the numbers and put them in their place
If the numbers are correct, the box will turn green
If the numbers are not in their place, the box will turn yellow
If there are no numbers, the box will be red.
Hope you enjoy.
